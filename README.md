March 15 to March 29, 2022
This is a two-week long timed CTF competition. Challenges increase in difficulty as players progress.
All are welcome to join but this CTF is recommended for players with some programming knowledge.
Players with no previous programming or CTF experience may prefer our noncompetitive picoGym challenges.
